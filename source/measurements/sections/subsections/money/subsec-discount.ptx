    <introduction>
      <p>
        <m>{\color{blue} \text{Discount}} </m> is the amount of money deducted from the marked price.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can also say, a total bill is usually sold at a discount. 
        Based on the <m>{\color{blue} \text{profit and loss }} </m> concept, the discount is basically the difference 
        between marked price and the selling price.
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>{\color{green} \text{Marked price  }} </m> is the cost set by the seller as per the market standard, 
        and <m>{\color{green} \text{selling price }} </m>  is the price at which the product or commodity has been sold. 
        When the selling price is less than the marked price, 
        then the buyer has said to be got some discount on it.

              <p>
                Akinyi walked into a shoe shop in Lusweti town. The marked price 
                of all ladie's show was <m>sh. \,1\,000</m>. Akinyi bargained with 
                the shop attendant to have the price reduced. She later paid <m>sh. \,900</m> for a 
                pair of shoes. She walked  happy.

          Sometimes, traders reduce the prices of items to attract customers. 
          Discount is the amount of money deducted from the marked price. 
          When given a discount, the buying price is less than the original 
          price.
        </p>
        <p>
          The price after the discount is reffered to as the marked price.
