    <introduction>
      <p>
        A bill shows the various items sold, their 
        quantities, the price per unit item and cost.
      </p>
      <p>
        It acts as a proof of the payment made or 
        received during a business transaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are different types of bills such as; <m> {\color{green} \text{Eectricity bills, telephone bills, 
        water bills, house bills, hotel bills, among others.}}</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        <m> {\color{black} \text{Components of a bill} }</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              A bill always has the <m> {\color{green} \text{Name of the shop }}</m> mentioned on top.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><m> {\color{green}\text{A unique number }}</m> is given to each of the bills. 
          it is called <m> {\color{green} \text{bill number }}</m> or the <m> {\color{green} \text{serial number }}</m> of a bill. 
          It help us find that particular bill easily. <m> {\color{black} \text{No two bill of the same 
          shop will have the same bill number.} }</m></li>
          <li>The date mentioned on the bill is called the <m> {\color{green} \text{Date of purchase. }}</m></li>
          <li>The <m> {\color{green} \text{list of items }}</m> purchased are always given under 
          the item column.</li>
          <li><m> {\color{green} \text{Quantity }}</m> is the total number of each item bought. 
          Quantity can either be in <m> {\color{green} \text{numbers}}</m> or <m> {\color{green} \text{weights.}}</m> For example 
          , one notebook or <m>1</m> kilogram of rice. In this case, the notebook 
          is quantified in numbers, and rice is quantified in weights.</li>
          <li>The <m> {\color{green} \text{cost }}</m> of each item or the rate 
          of each item is the <m> {\color{green} \text{original price }}</m> of each item.</li>
          <li><m> {\color{green} \text{Amount }}</m> to be paid for each item is 
          quantity multiplied by the rate of each item.</li>
          <li>The <m> {\color{green} \text{total amount }}</m> to be paid for the entire purchase is 
          the <m> {\color{green} \text{addition of amounts to be paid }}</m> for each of the items.</li>

            <p>the symbol <m> {\color{blue} @ }</m> is used to mean per unit. For example, <m>
              2</m> loaves of bread @<m>sh\,50</m> means that the cost of each
