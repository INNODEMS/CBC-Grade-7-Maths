        Did you take tea in the morning? Was it packed and labelled e.g 1 litre or 500ml? Now let's explore to understand why we learn volume and capacity.
        The Importance of Volume and Capacity in the Milk Industry. The milk industry relies heavily on volume and capacity calculations at every stageâ€”from production and storage to packaging and distribution. 
        Understanding these concepts ensures efficiency, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness in the industry.
