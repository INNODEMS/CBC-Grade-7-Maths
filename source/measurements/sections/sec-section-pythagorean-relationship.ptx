          The Pythagorean relationship is a fundamental principle in 
          geometry that describes the relationship between the sides of a right triangle. It states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This relationship is expressed by the equation <m>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</m>, where <m>c</m> is the length of the hypotenuse, and <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are the lengths of the other two sides.
