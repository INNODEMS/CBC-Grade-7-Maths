    </p>

    <p>
      Have you ever tried to solve a puzzle where you have to find a missing piece? 
      Algebra is like a mathematical puzzle where we use symbols, usually letters, to represent unknown numbers. 
      It helps us express patterns, solve problems, and understand relationships between numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em><term>What is Algebra?</term></em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses letters and symbols to represent numbers and operations. 
      Instead of writing only numbers, we use variables like <m>x, y</m>, or <m>z</m> to stand for unknown values. 
      For example, in the equation:
    </p>

    <p>
      <me>2x + 3 = 7</me>
    </p>

    <p>
      The letter <m>x</m> is a variable, meaning it can change. 
      In this case, we can find its value by solving the equation:
    </p>

    <p>
      <me>x = 12 -5 = 7</me>
    </p>

    <p>
      <em><term>Why is Algebra Important?</term></em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Algebra is useful in many real-life situations, such as:
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Problem Solving:</term> Algebra helps us solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Patterns and Relationships:</term> Algebra helps us identify patterns and relationships between numbers, making it easier to predict outcomes.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Shopping</term>: If a shirt costs Kshs <m>p</m> dollars and you buy <m>3</m> shirts, the total cost is <m>3p</m> dollars.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Traveling</term>: If a car moves at a speed of <m>s</m> km per hour, the distance traveled in <m>t</m> hours is <m>s \times t</m> km.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>  
    </p>
