    <p> 
      Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses letters and symbols to represent numbers and operations. Instead of writing only numbers, we use variables like x, y, or z to stand for unknown values.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example:
    </p>
    <p>
      <me>x + 3 = 8</me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter x is a variable.
    </p>

      <term>Why Learn Algebra?</term>
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal is to find out what number the letter (variable) represents by solving a problem or equation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Algebra is a powerful tool that can helps us solve problems in a smart and logical way.
