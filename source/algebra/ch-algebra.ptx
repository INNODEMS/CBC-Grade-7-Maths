    </p>

    <p> 
      Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses letters and symbols to represent numbers and operations. Instead of writing only numbers, we use variables like <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, or <m>z</m> to stand for unknown values.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example:
    </p>
    <p>
      <me>x + 3 = 8</me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter <m>x</m> is a variable.
    </p>

      <term>Why Learn Algebra?</term>
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal is to find out what number the letter (variable) represents by solving a problem or equation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Algebra helps us understand and solve problems in everyday life. It is used in different fields such as science, engineering, business, and even in daily activities like budgeting and shopping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Algebra is a powerful tool that can helps us solve problems in a smart and logical way.
