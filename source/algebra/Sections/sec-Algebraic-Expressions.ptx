  <title>Algebraic Expressions</title>
  
  <p>
    Algebra helps us understand and solve problems in everyday life. It is used in different fields such as science, engineering, and business. 
    For example, computer programming and architecture rely on algebraic concepts to calculate and create designs.

    <term>What is an Algebraic Expression?</term>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    An algebraic expression is a combination of numbers, letters (variables), and mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

      <p>Examples of algebraic expressions:</p>
        <p>
          <ul>

              <p>
                <m>2x + 3</m>
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                <m>4m - p</m>
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                <m>2(y + 3)</m>
              </p>
            </li>

          </ul>
        </p>
        
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>In these examples:</p>
      <p>
        <ul>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>x, m, p, y</m> are variables (unknown values).
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>2, 4, 3</m> are constants (fixed numbers).
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>+, -, Ã—</m> are operations.
            </p>
