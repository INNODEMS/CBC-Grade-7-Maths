        <p>
          Equating the masses on both sides leads to the formation of an equation.
        </p>

        <example>

          <statement>
            <p>
              Walibora bought a shirt and a pair of shorts. The cost of the pair of shorts was <m>150</m> shillings less than that of the shirt. If the two items cost <m>950</m> shillings. Write an equation representing the information using letter <m>x</m> as the cost of a shirt.
            </p>
          </statement>

          <solution>

            <p>
              Given that the cost of shirt is <m>x</m> then the cost of a pair of shorts is; <me>x - 150</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              The cost of a shirt and a pair of shorts can be represented using the expression shown below:
            </p>

            <p>
              <me>x + (x - 150) = 950</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              Simplifying the equation, we get:
            </p>

            <p>
              <me>2x - 150 = 950</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              Thus, the equation <me>2x - 150 = 950.</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              Represents the cost of a shirt and a pair of shorts.
            </p>

            <li>

                  On one side of a beam balance, place five matchboxes of the same weight.

          <p>
            <me>x + 4 = 7</me>
          </p>
          
        </statement>

        <solution>

          </sidebyside>

          <sidebyside>

            <p>
              By substracting <me>5</me> from both sides you balance the beam balance which is represents the following equation. <me>x + 4 - 4 = 7 - 4</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              <m>\arrowright</m>
            </p>

            <p>
              Simplifying, we have <me> x = 7 - 4</me>
            </p>

          </sidebyside>

          <p>
              Therefore,  <me>x = 3</me> as shown by the beam balance.
          </p>
          
        </solution>
          
        </example>

        <example>

          <statement>
            <p>
              Solve <me>5x - 3 = 17</me>
            </p>
          </statement>

          <solution>
            <p>
              Adding <m>3</m> to both sides we form this equation;
            </p>

            <p>
              <me>5x - 3 + 3 = 17 + 3</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              Simplifying we get;
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <me>5 x = 20</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              Dividing both sides by <me>5</me> we get;
            </p>

            <p>
              <me>\frac{5x}{5} = \frac{20}{5}</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              Therefore,
            </p>

            <p>
              <me>x = 4</me>
            </p>

          </solution>

        </example>

        <example>

          <statement>
            <p>
              Solve <me>\frac{1}{4}h = 3</me>
            </p>
          </statement>

          <solution>
            <p>
              Multiplying both sides by 4 we have;
            </p>

            <p>
              <me>\frac{1}{4}h \times 4 = 3 \times 4 </me>
            </p>

            <p>
              Simplifying the equation, we get;
            </p>

            <p>
              <me>\frac{4h}{4} = 12</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              Therefore, by cancelling <m>4</m> we have;
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <me>h = 12</me>
            </p>
          </solution>

        <example>

          <statement>

            <p>
              Dorine and Andrew are to share <m>10</m> kg of sugar so that Dorine gets <m>2</m> kg more than what Andrew receives. Find the weight received by each of them.
            </p>

          </statement>

          <solution>

            <p>
              Let Andrew's share be <me>x \text{kg}</me>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Dorine's share <me>= x + 2.</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              Thus, <me>x + (x + 2) = 10.</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              Simplifyinng the equation above we have;
            </p>

            <p>
              <me>2x + 2 = 10.</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              Carrying 2 to the other side and substracting it from <m>10</m> we have;
            </p>

            <p>
              <me>2x = 8.</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              Dividing <m>2</m> in both sides we get;
            </p>

            <p>
              <me>x = 4</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              Which is Andrew's share.
            </p>

            <p>
              To get Dorine's share, we substract Andrew's share from the total share.

            <p>
              <me>10 - 4 = 6</me> which is Dorine's share              
            </p>

            <p>
              Therefore, Andrew's share is <m>4</m> kg and Dorine's share is <m>6</m> kg.

            </p>

            <p>
              The number of books bought from Magut's shop is <me>x + 30</me>.

              Total amount <me>= 40x + 1200 + 40x</me>

            </p>

            <p>
              Thus <me>80x + 1200 = 4400</me>.
            </p>

            <p>
              <me>80x = 4400 - 1200.</me>
