  <title>Algebraic Expressions</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In everyday life, we often deal with numbers in different situations. For example:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Calculating the total cost when buying multiple items.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Keeping track of the number of students in a class.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Measuring distances and quantities.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Sometimes, we do not know the exact numbers, so we use letters or symbols to represent them.
      Algebraic expressions help us describe such situations using numbers, letters (variables), and mathematical operations.

    <title>Formation of Algebraic Expressions from Real-Life Situations</title>

    <p>
      Algebraic expressions are used to represent real-world situations mathematically. 
      In algebra, we use letters (variables) to represent unknown values, making it easier to describe changing quantities.

      <p>
        Work in pairs or small groups and complete the following tasks:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Think of a real-life situation where numbers change, such as a person buying or selling items.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Use a letter to represent an unknown quantity in your situation.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Form a mathematical expression using addition or subtraction.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Share your expression with the class and explain its meaning.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <term>Key Learning Point:</term> 
      Algebraic expressions help us describe real-life situations mathematically.
      The letters (variables) represent unknown values that can change depending on the situation.

    <title>Examples of Algebraic Expressions</title>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A football team has a total of <m>11</m> players, which includes goalkeepers and outfield players. 
          If the number of goalkeepers is <m>g</m>, form an algebraic expression to represent the number of outfield players.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <p>
          The total number of players in a football team is <m>11</m>.  
        </p>

        <p>
          The number of goalkeepers is represented by <m>g</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The number of outfield players can be determined by subtracting the goalkeepers from the total number of players.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus, the algebraic expression for outfield players is: <m>11 - g</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A school library contains <m>b</m> books on mathematics and <m>s</m> books on science.  
          Write an algebraic expression for the total number of books in the library.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <p>
          The number of mathematics books is <m>b</m>, and the number of science books is <m>s</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          To find the total number of books, we add the two amounts together.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus, the algebraic expression for the total books in the library is: <m>b + s</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <term>Note:</term> Since this expression has two different variables (<m>b</m> and <m>s</m>), it is called an algebraic expression with two unknowns.
