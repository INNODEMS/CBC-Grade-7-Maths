      <term>Introduction to Linear Inequalities</term>
    </p>

    <p>
      In everyday life, we often come across situations where things are not exactly equal but instead follow a comparison. 
      For example, if a bus can carry at most 50 passengers, it means the number of passengers should be less than or equal to 50. 
      Similarly, if a student must be older than 12 years to join a club, it means their age must be greater than 12.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mathematics helps us express such comparisons using <em><term>inequalities</term></em>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      An <em><term>inequality</term></em> is a mathematical statement that shows the relationship between two values when they are not equal. Unlike equations, which use the equal sign ( = ), inequalities use special symbols to compare values:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      
      <ul>

        <li>
          <p>
            <em><term>Greater than</term></em> <m>( \gt )</m>: Example: <m>x \gt 5</m> means <m>x</m> is any number greater than <m>5</m>, but <m>5</m> is not included.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <em><term>Less than</term></em> <m>( \lt )</m>: Example: <m>y \lt 10</m> means <m>y</m> is any number less than <m>10</m>, also in this case <m>10</m> is not included.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <em><term>Greater than or equal to</term></em> <m>( \ge )</m>: Example: <m>p \ge 3p</m> means <m>p</m> is either <m>3</m> or any number greater than <m>3</m>.
          </p>

        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <em><term>Less than or equal to</term></em> <m>( \leq )</m>: Example: <m>q \le 8</m> means <m>q</m> is either <m>8</m> or any number less than <m>8</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <term>What Are Linear Inequalities?</term>  
    </p>

    <p>
      A linear inequality is an inequality that involves a linear expression. It is similar to a linear equation but uses inequality symbols instead of an equal sign.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example:
    </p>

    
      <sidebyside>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>2x + 3 \ge 7</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>5y - 4 \le 6</m>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </sidebyside>
    

    <p>
      Just like linear equations, linear inequalities can be solved by performing operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
      However, one key difference is that when multiplying or dividing by a negative number, the inequality sign must be reversed.
    </p>

    <p>
      <term>Why Are Inequalities Important?</term>
    </p>

    <p>
      Inequalities help us solve real-world problems, such as:
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Determining budget constraints (e.g., "You can spend at most $100.")
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Setting age limits (e.g., "You must be at least 18 years old to vote.")
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Calculating time constraints (e.g., "The train arrives in less than 30 minutes.")
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Describing physical limits (e.g., "A container can hold no more than 5 liters of water.")
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      We are goin to learn how to solve and illustrate linear inequalities in numberlines, understand their applications, 
      and use them to make informed decisions in various situations.
