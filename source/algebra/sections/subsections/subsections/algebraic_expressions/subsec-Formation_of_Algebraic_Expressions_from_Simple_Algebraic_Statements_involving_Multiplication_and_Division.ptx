    <title>Formation of Algebraic Expressions from Simple Algebraic Statements involving Multiplication and Division</title>
        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    A carpenter cuts a wooden plank of length <m> L </m> meters into <m> 5 </m> equal pieces. Write an algebraic expression for the length of each piece.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    Total length = <m> L </m> meters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The plank is cut into <m> 5 </m> equal pieces, therefore the length of each piece
                </p>
                <p>
                    <me> = L รท 5 or L/5 meters </me>
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>

        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Mama Steve is a farmer. She has <m> t </m> cows. Each cow produces <m> 12 </m> litres of milk per day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Form an algebraic expression for the total amount of milk produced by all the cows in one day.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    Each cow produces <m> 12 </m> litres of milk per day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Number of cows = <m> t </m> cows
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore:
                </p>
                <p>
                    The total amount of milk produced is:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <me> 12 \times t </me>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <me> = 12 t </me> litres
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>
