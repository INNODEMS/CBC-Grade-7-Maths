        Form groups of 4-5 students.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each group will be given different real-life scenarios.
    </p>
    <p>
        Discuss and write algebraic expressions to represent the given situations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Discuss your solutions and explain your thoughts win the groups.

    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                An exercise book costs <m>Ksh 30</m>, and a pen costs <m>Ksh 15</m>. Jeff buys <m>a</m> books and <m>b</m> pens, write an algebraic expression for the total cost.
            </p>
        </statement>

        <solution>
            <p>
                <me>
                    The cost of one book = Ksh 30
                </me>

            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
                <me>
                    Jeff buys x books, the total cost of books = 30 \times x
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>
                <me>
                    = 30x
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>
                <me>
                    and y pens, the total cost of pens = 15 \times y

            <p>
                The total cost now is the sum of the two amounts:

            <p>
                <me>
                    = 30x + 15y
                </me>
            </p>
        </solution>
    </example>

    <example>
        <statement>
        <p>
            A boda boda rider charges <m>Ksh 50</m> for the first <m>2 km</m> and <m>Ksh 20</m> for each extra kilometre. If Joy travels <m>k</m> extra kilometres, form an expression for the total fare for the whole journey.
        </p>
        </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
            <me>
                The fixed charge for the first 2 km is Ksh 50
            </me>
        </p>
        <p>
            <me>
                Each extra kilometer costs Ksh 20
            </me>
        </p>
        <p>
            <me>
                Joy travels k extra kilometers, the extra charge;

        </p>
        <p>
            <me>
                20 \times k = 20k

        </p>
        <p>

                The total fare Joy paid

        </p>
        <p>
            <me>
                = 50 + 20k
