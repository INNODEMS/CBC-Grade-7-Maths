        Form groups of 4-5 students.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each group will be given different real-life scenarios.
    </p>
    <p>
        Discuss and write algebraic expressions to represent the given situations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Discuss your solutions and explain your thoughts win the groups.

    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                An exercise book costs <m>ksh  30</m>, and a pen costs <m>ksh  15</m>. Jeff buys <m>p</m> books and <m>b</m> pens, write an algebraic expression for the total cost.
            </p>
        </statement>

        <solution>
            <p>
                The cost of one book = ksh 30
            </p>
            <p>
                The cost of one pen = ksh 15
            </p>
            <p>
                Jeff buys <m>p</m> books, the total cost of books: <me>= 30 \times p</me>
            </p>
            <p>
                <me>
                    = 30p
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>
                and <m>b</m> pens, the total cost of pens: <me>= 15 \times b</me>
                
            </p>
            <p>
                <me>
                    = 15b
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>
                The total cost now is the sum of the two amounts:
            </p>
            <p>
                <me>
                    = 30p + 15b
                </me>
            </p>
        </solution>
    </example>

    <example>
        <statement>
        <p>
            A boda boda rider charges <m> ksh 50 </m> for the first <m> 2 km </m> and <m> ksh 20 </m> for each extra kilometre. If Joy travels <m> k </m> extra kilometres, form an expression for the total fare for the whole journey.
        </p>
        </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
            The fixed charge for the first <m> 2 km </m> = <m> ksh 50</m>
        </p>
        <p>
            Each extra kilometer costs <m> ksh 20 </m>
        </p>
        <p>
            Joy travels <m> k </m> extra kilometers, the extra charge;
        </p>
        <p>
            <me>
                20  \times  k = 20 k
            </me>
        </p>
        <p>
            The total fare Joy paid is:
        </p>
        <p>
            <m> fixed charge for the first 2 km + Extra kilometres charges </m>
        </p>
        <p>
            <me>
                = 50 + 20 k
            </me>
        </p>
      </solution>
