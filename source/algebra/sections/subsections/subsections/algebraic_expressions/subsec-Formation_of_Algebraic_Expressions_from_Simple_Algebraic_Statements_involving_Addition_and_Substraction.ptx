    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Steph is 3 years younger than her sister. If her sister is <m> w </m> years old, form an algebraic expression for Steph's age.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                Let the age of Steph's sister be <m> w </m> years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since Steph is <m> 3 </m> years younger, we subtract <m> 3 </m> from her sister's age.
            </p>
            <p>
                The algebraic expression for Steph's age is:
            </p>
            <p>
                <me>
                    (y - 3)
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>
                Steph's age is <m>(y-3) </m> years
            </p>
        </solution>
    </example>
