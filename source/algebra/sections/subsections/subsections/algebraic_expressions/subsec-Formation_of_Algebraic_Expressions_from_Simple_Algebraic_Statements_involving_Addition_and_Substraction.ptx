            Georg has some pencils. He buys <m>4</m> more pencils from a shop. Later, he gives <m>2</m> pencils to his friend.

                        Use a letter to represent the number of pencils Brian originally had.

    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Steph is 3 years younger than her sister. If her sister is w years old, form an algebraic expression for Steph's age.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                <me>
                    Let the age of Steph's sister be w years.
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>
                <me>
                    Since Steph is 3 years younger, we subtract 3 from her sister's age.
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>
                <me>
                    The algebraic expression for Steph's age is:
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>
                <me>
                    y - 3
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>
                Steph's age is <m>(y-3) years</m>
            </p>
        </solution>
