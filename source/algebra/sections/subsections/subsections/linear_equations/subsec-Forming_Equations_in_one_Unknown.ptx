        <example>

          <statement>
            <p>
              Walibora bought a shirt and a pair of shorts. The cost of the pair of shorts was <m>150</m> shillings less than that of the shirt. If the two items cost <m>950</m> shillings. Write an equation representing the information using letter <m>x</m> as the cost of a shirt.
            </p>
          </statement>

          <solution>

            <p>
              The cost of one pair of shorts is <me>= x - 150</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              The cost of a shirt and a pair of shorts can be represented using the expression shown below:
            </p>

            <p>
              <me> x + (x - 150) = 950</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              Simplifying the equation, we get:
            </p>

            <p>
              <me>2x - 150 = 950</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              Thus the equation <me>2x - 150 = 950.</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              Represents the cost of a shirt and a pair of shorts.
