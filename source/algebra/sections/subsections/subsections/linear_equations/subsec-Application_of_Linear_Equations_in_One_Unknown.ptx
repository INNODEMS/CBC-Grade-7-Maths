        <example>

          <statement>

            <p>
              Dorine and Andrew are to share <m>10</m> kg of sugar so that Dorine gets <m>2</m> kg more than what Andrew receives. Find the weight received by each of them.
            </p>

          </statement>

          <solution>

            <p>
              Let Andrew's share be <m>x</m> kg.
            </p>

            <p>
              Dorine's share is; <me>= x + 2.</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              Thus, <me>x + x + 2 = 10.</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              <me>2x + 2 = 10.</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              <me>2x = 8.</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              <me>x = 4</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              Andrew's share is <m>4</m> kg and Dorine's share is <m>6</m> kg.
            </p>

        <example>

          <statement>

            <p>
              Makanda and Magut sell exercise books at <m>40</m> shillings per book. 
              Peter bought some exercise books from Makanda's shop and from Magut's shop. 
              In Magut's shop, he bought <m>30</m> more books than he bought from Makanda's shop. 
              If he spent a total of <m>4400</m> shillings buying the books, find the number of books bought from each shop.
            </p>

          </statement>

          <solution>

            <p>
              Let the number of books bought from Makanda's shop be <m>x</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
              The number of books bought from Magut's shop is; <me>x + 30</me>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Amount spent in Magut's shop is; <me>= 40 (x + 30).</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              <me>= 40x + 1200.</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              Amount spent in Makanda's shop is; <me>= 40x.</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              Total amount; <me>= 40x + 1200 + 40x</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              <me>= 80x + 1200.</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              Thus, <me>80x + 1200 = 4400</me>.
            </p>

            <p>
              <me>80x = 4400 - 1200.</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              <me>80x = 3200.</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              <me>x = 40.</me>
            </p>

            <p>
              Number of books bought from Makanda's shop is <m>40</m> and from Magut's shop is <m>40 + 30</m> = <m>70</m>.
