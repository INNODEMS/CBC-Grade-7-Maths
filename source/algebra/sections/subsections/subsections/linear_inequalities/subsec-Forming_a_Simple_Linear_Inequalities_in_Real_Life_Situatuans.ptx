      <example>

        <statement>

          <p>
            Jane had some oranges. She gave Mwara 5 of them. She was left with at most <m>12</m> of them. Write an inequality to represent this statement.
          </p>

        </statement>

        <solution>

          <p>
            Let the number of oranges be <m>x</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Remaining oranges after sharing <m>5</m> to Mwara will be <m>x - 5.</m>
          </p>

          <p>
            Total oranges Jane had was atleast <m>12.</m>
          </p>

          <p>
            Therefore, <m>x - 5 = 12</m> or <m>x - 5 \lt 12.</m>
          </p>

          <p>
            The equations above can be written in an algebaric form as;
          </p>

          <p>
            <m>x - 5 \le 12.</m>
          </p>

        </solution>
