          Bag <m>A</m> contains ,<m>x</m> mangoes. Two mangoes are added to it. The total number of mangoes is ether equal to or less than the number of mangoes in bag <m>B</m>, which contains <m>30</m> mangoes.

      <example>

        <statement>

          <p>
            Jane had some oranges. She gave Mwara 5 of them. She was left with at most <m>12</m> of them. Write an inequality to represent this statement.
          </p>

        </statement>

        <solution>

          <p>
            Let the number of oranges be <m>x</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Remaining oranges after sharing <m>5</m> to Mwara will be <m>x - 5.</m>
          </p>

          <p>
            Total oranges Jane had was atleast <m>12.</m>
          </p>

          <p>Therefore,
            <md>
              <mrow> x - 5 = \amp 12</mrow>
            </md>
            or
            <md>
              <mrow> x - 5 \lt \amp 12.</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>

          <p>
            The equations above can be combined so that it can be written in an algebaric form as;
          </p>

          <p>
            <md>
              <mrow>x - 5 \le \amp 12. </mrow>
            </md>
          </p>

        </solution>
