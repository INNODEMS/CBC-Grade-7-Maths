      <p>
        A <em><term>number line</term></em> is a straight horizontal line used to represent numbers. It helps us visualize numbers, compare values, and understand inequalities easily.
      </p>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              A number line extends infinitely in both directions.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              It has a zero <m>(0)</m> in the center, with positive numbers to the right and negative numbers to the left.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              The numbers increase as we move to the right and decrease as we move to the left.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              The numbers are evenly spaced on the line.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

        Take a look at the numberline below:

        We can illustrate inequalities on a number line by understanding the inequality symbols.

      <p>
        An <term>open point</term> is used to represent a number that is not included in the inequality.

        A <term>closed point</term> is used to represent a number that is included in the inequality.
