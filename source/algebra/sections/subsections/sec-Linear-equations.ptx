      <p>
        Have you ever tried to balance a scale? 
        If you add weight to one side, you must do the same to the other side to keep it balanced. 
        This idea is the foundation of <em><term>linear equations.</term></em> 
      </p>

      <p>
        <term>What is a Linear Equation?</term>
      </p>

      <p>
        A <term>linear equation</term> is an equation where the highest power of the variable is 1. It has a simple form, such as:
      </p>

      <p>
        <me>2x + 3 = 7</me>
      </p>

      <p>
        Here, <m>x</m> is the unknown number, called a variable. To find <m>x</m>, we solve the equation step by step:
      </p>

      <p>
        <me>2x = 7 − 3</me>
      </p>

      <p>
        <me>2x = 4</me>
      </p>

      <p>
        <me>x = \frac{2}{4}</me>
      </p>

      <p>
        <me> x ​= 2</me>
      </p>

      <p>
        This means the value of <m>x</m> that makes the equation true is <m>2.</m>
      </p>

      <p>
        <term>Why are Linear Equations Important?</term>
      </p>

      <p>
        Linear equations help us solve real-world problems, such as:

        <ul>

          <li>
            <p>
              <term>Calculating expenses:</term> If a book costs <m>b</m> dollars and you buy <m>4</m> books, the total cost is <m>4b</m>. If the total cost is <m>$40</m>, you can find the price of one book by solving <m>4b = 40</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <term>Finding unknown ages:</term> If a person's age is <m>x</m>, and their younger sibling is <m>3</m> years younger, we can write this as <m>x - 3.</m>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <term>Distance and speed calculations:</term> If a car travels at <m>s</m> km per hour for <m>t</m> hours, the distance covered is <m>s \times t</m> km.
            </p>
          </li>

        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        You are going to learn how to:

        <ul>

          <li>
            <p>
              <term>Understand equations</term> – Recognizing how equations express equality.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <term>Solve for unknowns</term> – Finding the value of variables step by step.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <term>Use real-life applications</term> – Applying equations to everyday situations.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <term>Graph linear equations</term> – Representing equations on a coordinate plane.
            </p>
          </li>

        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Linear equations are like puzzles waiting to be solved. 
        With practice, you will see how they can make problem-solving easier and fun.
