    <title>Squares and square roots</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
             Squares and square roots are fundamental concepts in mathematics, with many applications in our daily lives.
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider a surveyor tasked with determining the side length of a square
            garden with an area of <m>400</m> m<m>^2</m>. Since all sides of a square are equal, the surveyor
            needs to find a number that, when multiplied by itself, results in <m>400</m>. This is where the concept of square roots comes into play.
        </p>
        <p>
            To find the side length of the garden, the surveyor needs to determine the square root of <m>400</m>.
            In this case, the square root of <m>400</m> is <m>20</m> since <m>20 \times 20 = 400</m>, meaning each side of the garden is <m>20</m> m long.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can represent this mathematically as follows:
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
            To illustrate, consider the number <m>3</m>: The square of <m>3</m>, written as <m>3^2</m>, is <m>9</m>. 
            This means multiplying <m>3</m> by itself <m>(3 \times 3 = 9)</m>. Conversely, the square root of <m>9</m> denoted as <m>\sqrt{9}</m> is <m>3</m>. 
            This operation finds the number that, when multiplied by itself, gives 9.
            We see that square and square roots are both opposite concept in nature to each other. 
        </p>  -->
        <!-- <p>
            This concepts are applied in fields such as geometry when calculating the area of squares or determning the length of diagonal.
        </p> -->
