    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Which of the following numbers are divisible by <m>2</m>?
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>49\,397, 49\,273, 47\,164, 24\,840</m>
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                The number <m>47\,164</m> is divisible by <m>2</m> because the digit in the ones place value is an even number.
            </p>
            <p>
                The number <m>24\,840</m> is divisible by <m>2</m> because the digit in the ones place value is zero.
            </p>
