                1. Write down all the years between <m>2000</m> and <m>2025</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                    2. Look at the last digit of every year if it is zero.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. If the last digit is zero then the number is divisible by <m>10</m> and if the last digit is not zero then it is not divisible by <m>10</m>.

    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Which of the following numbers are divisible by <m>10</m>?
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>12\,470</m>, <m>78\,945</m>, <m>809\,130</m>, <m>1\,265\,785</m>
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                <m>12\,470</m> and <m>809\,130</m> are divisible by <m>10</m> because their digits in the ones place value is zero.
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>78\,945</m>, <m>1\,265\,785</m> are not divisible by <m>10</m> because their digits in the ones place value is not zero.
