            <p>
            1. Working in groups, find <m>1</m> mathematical textbook and put it at the table.
            </p>
            <p>
            2. In turns, each group member to close their eyes and open a page in the textbook.
            </p>
            <p>
            3. One of the goup members to write down the number pages.
            </p>
            <p>
            4. Test if the numbers are divisible by <m>2</m> that is if the last digit is an even number and also test if the numbers are divisible by <m>3</m> that is add the digits and check if the sum is divisible by <m>3</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
            5. If the number is divisible by both <m>2</m> and <m>3</m> then it is divisble by <m>6</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
            6. Share your group's findings with the class. What did you notice about the numbers divisible by <m>6</m>.
