    <title>Least Common Multiple </title>
    <p>
        The Least Common Multiple of two or more numbers is the smallest number that is divisible by two or more numbers without a reminder.

    </p>
    <p>
    Example:
    </p>
    <p>
    Murunga and Onyimbo have busy schedules but want to meet regularly for a football game. Murunga have free time every <m>12</m> days and Onyimbo has free time every <m>18</m> days. To find when they will both be free on the same day to play, we solve using LCM.
    </p>
    <p>
    Therefore, we list the multiples of Murunga's free days: <m>12,24,36,48,60,72,...</m> and Onyimbo's free days: <m>18,36,54,72,90,...</m>
    </p>
    <p>
    The common  multiples are <m>36,72</m> and the smallest commom multiple is <m>36</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hence Muranga and Onyimbo will both be free on the <m>36</m> th day to play football game.

            1. In groups of <m>5</m> students each, play a game such that if the first person gives a number the next person will add <m>2</m> to the number and the third person will add <m>3</m> to the number formed by the second person and so is the forth and fifth person.i.e if the first person chooses <m>6</m> then the next numbers would be <m>8,11,15,20</m>  .
            </p>
            <p>
            2. Write down the multiples of each numbers i.e multiples of <m>6 = </m> <m>6,12,18,24,30,36,42,48,54...</m> and the multiples of <m>8 = </m> <m>8,16,24,32,40,48,56,64,...</m>
            </p>
            <p>
            3. Look at the lists of multiples of numbers formed and find the smallest multiple that appears in both lists which is the LCM. FOR example the LCM of <m>6</m> and <m>8</m> is <m>24</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
            4.Use the LCM to check if the number is divided by the original numbers i.e <me>24 \div 6 = 4 </me> and <me>24 \div 8 =3 </me> which are all whole numbers . Hence <m>24</m> is the LCM.
