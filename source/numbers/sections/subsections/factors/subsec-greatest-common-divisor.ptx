        <title>Greatest Common Divisor</title>
        <p>
            GCD is the largest positive integer number that divides evenly into two or more numbers with zero remainder.
            It is also known as the Highest Common Factor (HFC).
        </p>
        <p>
            Example in real life:
        </p>
        <p>
            Esther and Shillah have packets of snacks and want to share them equally amoung the top mathematics performers in grade <m>7</m> without leaving leftovers.
            Esther have <m>36</m> crackers and Shillah has <m>54</m> cookies.
        </p>
        <p>
             The largest number of top performers Shillah and Esther can gift is solved using GCD.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the factors of <m>36</m> are <m>1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18,36</m> and the factors of <m>54</m> are <m>1,2,3,6,9,18,27,54</m>. 
            This implies that the higher number of top performers to be gifted is <m>18</m>.
