    <introduction>
        <p>
            Composite numbers are numbers that has more than two factors,meaning it can be divided 
            evenly by numbers other than <m>1</m> and itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Process of breaking a composite number is prime factorization and prime factorization expresses 
            the number as the product of prime numbers.

        <p>
            Factors are numbers that can divide a given number without leaving a remainder.
            Factors are also called divisors.

            Tumaini school is planning a sports day and Kamau needs to organize students into equal-sized teams.
            There are <m>24</m> students in his class. Kamau needs factors of <m>24</m> to divide the students 
            into equal teams so that no one is left out.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the factors of <m>24</m> are <m>1,2,3,4,6,8,12</m> and <m>24</m>. 
            It gives Kamau possible ways to divide the students into equally.

                                We check the divisibility of each number step by step:

                                            Therefore, <m>1</m> is a factor of <m>40</m>.

                                            Therefore, <m>3</m> is not a factor of <m>40</m>.

                                            Therefore, <m>4</m> is a factor of <m>40</m>.

                            <p>
                                We continue this process for other numbers to check if they divide <m>40</m> without leaving a remainder.

                                After completing the checks, we find that <m>1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20,</m> and <m>40</m> all divide <m>40</m> exactly.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Therefore, the factors of <m>40</m> are <m>1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20,</m> and <m>40</m>.

                            <p>
                                Another way to find the factors of a number is by identifying pairs of numbers that, when multiplied together, produce that number. 
                                If <m>a \times b = c</m>, then both <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are factors of <m>c</m>.

                            <p>
                                To determine the factors of <m>84</m>, we find all pairs of numbers whose product equals <m>84</m>:

                                Since we have identified all factor pairs of <m>84</m>, we can list its factors as follows:

                            <p>
                                The factors of <m>84</m> are <m>1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 21, 28, 42,</m> and <m>84</m>.

        <title>Prime factors</title>
        <p>
            Let's start by defining what are prime numbers. 
            Prime numbers are positive whole numbers 
            that are greater than 1, that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller numbers. Examples of prime numbers are <m>2,3,5,7,11,...</m>
        </p>
        <p>
            A prime factor is a prime number that can divide a given number without a remainder.
        </p>
        <p>
            Example in real life:
        </p>
        <p>
            Okuse, an architect want to design a strong and beautiful classroom. To make sure the classroom is stable, Okuse use blocks of the strongest materials. Now, think of prime numbers as the strongest building block in mathematics such that if we want to know what the number <m>60</m> is made of we break it down into it's prime factors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Start with <m>60 = 2 \times 30</m>
        </p>
        <p>
            <m>30 = 2 \times 15</m>
        </p>
        <p>
            <m>15 = 3 \times 5</m>
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore,  prime factors of <m>60</m> are <m>2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 5</m>

                 <p> 
                    We start with the smallest prime number, which is <m>2</m>. 
                    Let's divide <m>48</m> by <m>2</m>: <m>48 \div 2 = 24</m>.
                     Since it divides exactly, <m>2</m> is our first prime factor. 

                 </p>
                <p> 
                    Next, we take <m>24</m> and divide it by <m>2</m> again: <m>24 \div 2 = 12</m>. 
                    It divides exactly, so <m>2</m> is our second prime factor. 
                </p> 
                <p> 
                    Now, we take <m>12</m> and divide it by <m>2</m> once more: <m>12 \div 2 = 6</m>. It divides exactly, so <m>2</m> is our third prime factor. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Next, we take <m>6</m> and divide it by <m>2</m> again: <m>6 \div 2 = 3</m>. It divides exactly, so <m>2</m> is our fourth prime factor.
                 </p>
                <p> 
                    Finally, we have <m>3</m>, which is already a prime number and cannot be divided further.
                 </p>
                <p> 
                    So, the prime factors of <m>48</m> are: <m>48 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3</m>.

                    To find the prime factors of <m>88</m>, we will use a factor tree. 
                    A factor tree helps us break down a composite number into its prime factors step by step.

                    Here’s how the factor tree for <m>88</m> looks:

                    We start by breaking <m>88</m> into <m>2</m> and <m>44</m>. 
                    Then, <m>44</m> is broken into <m>2</m> and <m>22</m>, and
                    finally, <m>22</m> is broken into <m>2</m> and <m>11</m>.
                    Since <m>11</m> is a prime number, we stop here. 
                </p> 
                <p>
                    We can't factor any more, so we have found the prime factors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, the product of prime factors of <m>88</m> is : <m>88 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 11 </m>
