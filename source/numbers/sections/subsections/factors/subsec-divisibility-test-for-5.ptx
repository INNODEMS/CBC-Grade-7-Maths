                1. Working in groups of 5, think of numbers between <m>50</m> and <m>200</m> and select five numbers from the range .
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Check which of your selected numbers are divisible by <m>5</m> and write them down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Look at the last digits of the numbers that are divisible by <m>5</m>.
