        <title>Divisibility test for 4</title>
        
        <p>
            A number is divisible by 4 if its digits in the ones and tens place value are both zero or the number formed by the digits in the ones and tens place value is divisible by 4

            <statement>
                <p>
                    1. Each student to write a number between <m>10</m> and <m>100</m> and put it on a table at the center of the class.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. P lace your math textbooks in the center of the classroom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. In turns, pick a number from the table without choosing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. Check if the number is divisible by <m>4</m> by looking if the digits at the ones and tens place value are both zero or the number formed by the digits in the ones and tens place value is divisible by 4.

                </p>
                <p>
                    5. If the number is divisible by <m>4</m> then pick <m>4</m> textbooks and remain standing and if the number is not divisible by <m>4</m> pass and go take a seat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    6. Share with your fellow learners the numbers that are divisible by <m>4</m>.

                            <p>
                                Now divide <m>82</m> by <m>4</m>
                                <me>82 \div 4 = 20 \text{ remainder } 2 </me>
                                Since <m>82</m> is not divisible by <m>4</m> hence  <m>362\,982</m> is not divisible by <m>4</m>

                                Since <m>67</m> is not divisible by <m>4</m> hence <m>289\,367</m> is not divisible by <m>4</m>
