    <title>Divisibility test for 11</title>
    <p>
        To check if a number is divisible by <m>11</m> , subtract the sum of the digits in odd positions from the sum of the digits in even positions. 
        If the result is zero or a multiple of <m>11</m> , the number is divisible by 11.
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>\textbf{Example}</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        1. To identify if <m> 2728 </m> is divisible by <m>11</m>, assign positions i.e 
        <m>\rightarrow</m> digits in odd positions are: <m> 2 + 2 = 4 </m>, digits in even positions are: <m>7 + 8 = 15</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since <m> 15 - 4 = 11</m> <m>\rightarrow</m> <m> 2728 </m> is divisible by <m>11</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
       2. To identify if <m> 1234 </m> is divisible by <m>11</m>, assign positions i.e 
        <m>\rightarrow</m> digits in odd positions are: <m> 1 + 3 = 4 </m>, digits in even positions are: <m>2 + 4 = 6</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
       Since <m> 6 - 4 = 2</m> <m>\rightarrow</m> <m> 1234 </m> is not divisible by <m>11</m>.

            <p>
               1. Working in groups of <m>5</m> , each student to create a 4-digit number using digits from <m>1</m> to <m>9</m> and writes it on a piece of paper.
            </p>
            <p>
               2. In turns, each learner to read out the number they formed for the group to check if it is divisible by <m>11</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
               3. Each group to write down numbers they found out to be divisible by <m>11</m>. Share the numbers with your fellow learners.
            </p>
            <p>
               4. Discuss what strategies helped you to identify numbers that are divisible by <m>11</m>.Did you notice any patterns?

        <statement>
            <p>
                Is <m>895\,136</m> divisible by <m>11</m>?

        <solution>
            <p>
                <ol marker="a)">
                    <li>
                        <p>
                           First, find the sum of the digits in odd number positions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <m>8+5+3=16</m>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Next we find the sum of digits in even positions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <m>9+1+6=16</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Finding their difference we get:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <m>16-16 = 0</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the differenece is <m>0</m>, then  <m>895\,136</m> is divisible by <m>11.</m>
