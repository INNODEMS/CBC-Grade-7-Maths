                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Find the sum of the digits in the alternate places.

                        <p>
                            <m>9+1+6=16</m>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Find their difference.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <m>16-16 = 0</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                since the differenece is <m>0</m>, then  <m>895\,136</m> is divisible by <m>11.</m>
