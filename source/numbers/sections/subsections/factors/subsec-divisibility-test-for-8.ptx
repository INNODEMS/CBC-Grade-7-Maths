            1. Working in small groups with your classmates, use shoe sizes to generate numbers and write them down.
            </p>
            <p>
            2. Combine two shoe sizes to create new numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
            3. Look at the last three digits of the numbers formed and check if these last three digits are divisible by <m>8</m> by dividing it by <m>8</m>. If it is divisible by <m>8</m> it should divide the number without leaving a remainder.
            </p>
            <p>
            4. Write down whether each combined number is divisible by <m>8</m> or not.
