  <title>Odd numbers</title>
  <p>
     Odd numbers are numbers that cannot be divided by two without leaving a remainder. The digit in the ones place value of an odd number is <m>1,3,5,7</m> or <m>9</m>.

        <p>
          1. Outside the classroom, learners to stand in a circle and be assigned a number starting from <m>1 </m> to the last person.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The student assigned number <m> 1</m> to stay standing and the student with number <m> 2</m> will sit down first. 
        </p>
        <p>
           3. After number <m> 2</m> sits, skip the next student at number <m> 3</m> and ask the student with number <m> 4 </m> to sit down.
              Fellow learners to shout out the next number to sit down.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Continue with this pattern where each student who sits down will skip the next student and have the student after them sit down.
             So after number <m>4</m> sits, number <m>6</m> will sit, then number <m>8</m>, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            5. Once all even-numbered students have sat down, the students still standing will shout out their numbers one by one.
        </p>
        <p>
            6. What are the last digits of the numbers the standing students shouted out?
        </p>
        <p>
            7. What do we call numbers that are not divisible by <m>2</m>?

      <solution>
        <p>
          <m>57,769,6\,545,46\,541</m> are odd numbers since their digits in the ones place value are not divisible by two.
