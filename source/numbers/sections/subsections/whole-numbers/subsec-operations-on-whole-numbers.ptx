        Kahawa Tea company harvested <m>326\,548\,957</m> kilograms of tea. The company exported <m>128\,349\,263</m> kilograms of coffee.
       </p>
       <p>
        1. Work out the kilograms of tea that remained after the export.

         If the digits in a column, starting from the right-hand side, result in a negative value when subtracted, you borrow from the first digit in the next column to the left..
         </p>
         <p>
         The digit you borrow from will be reduced by 1, while the digit you borrow to will increase by 10.  See the example above.
