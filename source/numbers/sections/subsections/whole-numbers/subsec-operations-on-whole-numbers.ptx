    <title>Addition</title>
    <p>
       Addition is a mathematical operation that involves combining two or more numbers to find their total.
        We use place value of digits to add numbers that is, while adding you allign the digits according to their place values.

        <p>
           1. In groups of <m>5</m>,  think of an addition word question and write it down on a blank paper. 
              For example: 
              Sera had <m>56 </m> guests at her birthday party in the morning and <m>42</m> more guests in the afternoon.
              How many guests attended her birthday party in total?
        </p>
          <p>
            2. Work out the problem as a group and discuss how to add <m>3,4, \text{or} 5</m> - digit numbers i.e <m>2543 + 678</m>
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Exchange the written word questions with other groups and work out each other's question.

        Jerotich has <m>3</m> farms. She stored 90,000 litres of water using three tanks of equal size to irrigate the farms. One morning, she drew water from one tank to water the farms. Each farm used <m>9200</m> litres of water. Later in the evening, she added <m>12 356</m> litres of water into the tank she had drawn water from. She wondered what amount of water remained by the end of the day and she wanted to know the amount of water she needed to add to the tank in order to fill the tank to its original capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
        In groups of <m>5</m>, help Jerotich identify the amount of water that remained in the tank by the end of the day and the capacity she needed to fill the tank to its original capacity.

        To solve for this, start with division i.e

        By performing division, the expression is reduced to :
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>524 + 256 - 137</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        Next we add: <m>524 + 256 = 780</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        <m> = 780 - 137 = 643</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, <m>524 + 256 - 548 \div 4 = 643</m>
      </p>
    </solution>

    <statement>
      <p>
        Work out:
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>546 \div 2 \times 12 - 1254 + 3546</m>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        The task involves <m>4</m> operations and we perform it in the following order: division, multiplication, addition then subtraction.
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>546 \div 2 = 273</m>
      </p>
      <p>
      <m>= 273 \times 12 - 1254 + 3546 </m>
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>= 273 \times 12 = 3276</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>3276 - 1254 + 3546 </m> rewriting this to perform addition we get:
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>3276 + 3546 = 6822</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, we subtract:
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>6822- 1254 = 5568</m> 
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, <m>546 \div 2 \times 12 - 1254 + 3546 = 5568</m>
      </p>
    </solution>
