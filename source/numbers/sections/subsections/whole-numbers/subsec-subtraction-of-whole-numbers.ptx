        Kahawa Tea company harvested <m>326\,548\,957</m> kilograms of tea. The company exported <m>128\,349\,263</m> kilograms of coffee.
       </p>
       <p>
        1. Work out the kilograms of tea that remained after the export.

        <statement>
          <p>
          Fishermen across the country exported <m>4\,563\,275</m> kg of fish in the first year. In the second year; the mass of fish decreased by <m>732\,738</m> kg. Work out the mass of fish that the fishermen exported in the second year: 
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>

          <p>
            First, subtract the decrease in mass of fish in the second year from the mass of fish in the first year.

         If the digits in a column, starting from the right-hand side, result in a negative value when subtracted, you borrow from the first digit in the next column to the left..
         </p>
         <p>
         The digit you borrow from will be reduced by 1, while the digit you borrow to will increase by 10.  See the example above.
         </p>
         <p>
          Therefore, the mass of fish the fisherman exported in the second year was <m>3\,830\,537</m> kg.
