            A number sequence is a list of numbers that follow a specific pattern or rule. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Think of it like a list of numbers where each number is related to the one before it in a certain way e.g <m>2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...</m>
            Here, you are adding 2 each time. These are all numbers that can be divided by 2.
        </p> 
        <p>
            The pattern could involve adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing by a certain number each time.

        </p>
        <p>
            Look for the pattern. Identify if the numbers are increasing or decreasing. Find out if there is consistent amount being added or subtracted.
        </p>
        <p>
            See if you can predict the next number based on the rule you find.

               Identify the missing number in the following sequences. 
            </p>

        </statement>
           <solution>
            <p>
               1. The first step is to find the differences between consecutive numbers:
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                           <m>400 - 50 = 350 </m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>850 - 400 = 450</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>1400 - 850 = 550</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                So, the differences are <m>350\, ,450\,, 550\,</m> which are increasing by <m>100</m> each time.
            </p>
            <p>
                 2. Next step is to predict the next differences:
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                           <m> 550 + 100 = 650</m> (the next difference)
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>650 + 100 = 750</m> (the following difference)
                            
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                           <m> 750 + 100 = 850 </m>(the last difference)
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                3.Add these differences to the last known number (1400):
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                           <m>1400 + 650 = 2050 </m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>2050 + 750 = 2800</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>2800 + 850 = 3650</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                So the missing numbers are <m>2050 \,,2800\,,3650 </m>
            </p>
            <p>
                4. Finally, the sequence is <m>50\, ,400\,, 850\, ,1400\, ,2050\, ,2800\, ,3650</m>
            </p>
            </solution>
        </example> 
        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Rearrange the following numbers in ascending order and identify the next two numbers in each sequence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <m>648\, ,24\, ,216\,,8\,,72</m>
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                  The given numbers are: <m>648\,, 24\, ,216\, ,8\, ,72</m> . 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When rearranged in ascending order, we get:
                </p>
                <p>
                   <m>8\, ,24\,, 72\, ,216\,, 648</m>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, let's examine the relationship between the numbers:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                               <m> 8 \times 3 = 24</m>
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <m>24 \times 3 = 72</m>
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                              <m> 72 \times 3 = 216</m>
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                               <m> 216 \times 3 = 648</m>
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the above,each number is being multiplied by 3 to get the next number.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, the next <m>2</m> numbers are:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>

                               <m> 648 \times 3 = 1944</m>

                Assume Morara starts with 0 shillings in his account at the beginning.
            </p>
            <p>
                A week has <m>7</m> days and his account balance on the first day is sh <m>1,250</m>.

               <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Day 1: <m>0 + 1250 = 1250</m>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Day 2: <m>1250 + 1250 = 2500</m>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Day 3: <m>2500 + 1250 = 3750</m>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Day 4: <m>3750 + 1250 = 5000</m>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Day 5: <m>5000 + 1250 = 6250</m>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Day 6: <m>6250 + 1250 = 7500</m>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Day 7: <m>7500 + 1250 = 8750</m>

            <p>
                Therefore, the sequence of Morara's bank account balance at the end of each day for one week is:
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>1250\, ,2500\, ,3750\, ,5000\,, 6250\, ,7500\, ,8750</m>
