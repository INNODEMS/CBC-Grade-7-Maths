    <title>Reciprocal of fractions</title>
    <p>
        The reciprocal of a fraction is obtained by interchanging the numerator and the denominator. 
        The product of a fraction and its reciprocal is <m>1.</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        In general, the reciprocal of a fraction <m>\frac{a}{b}</m> is written as <m>\frac{b}{a}</m> where <m>(a,b \text{ are whole numbers})</m>.
        For example, the reciprocal of <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> is <m>\frac{3}{2}.</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        We can also find the reciprocal of fraction by dividing 1 by the fraction.

    <example>
        <statement>
            <p>
                What is the reciprocal of <m>\frac{17}{39}</m>?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                To get the reciprocal of <m>\frac{17}{39}</m>, we swap the numerator and the denominator.
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>\frac{{\color{red}17}}{{\color{blue}39}} \text{ to get } \frac{{\color{blue}39}}{{\color{red}17}}</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, the reciprocal of <m>\frac{{\color{red}17}}{{\color{blue}39}} \text{ is } \frac{{\color{blue}39}}{{\color{red}17}}.</m>

                            <m>{\color{red}3} \frac{{\color{blue}2}}{{\color{green}7}} = \frac{({\color{green}7} \times {\color{red}3})+{\color{blue}2}}{{\color{green}7}} = \frac{23}{7}</m>

                        <p>
                            Therefore, the reciprocal of <m>3 \frac{2}{7} \text{ is } \frac{7}{23}.</m>
