    <title>Adding mixed fractions</title>
    <p>
        A mixed fraction is a combination of a whole number and a fraction. 
        To add two mixed fractions, we first change them into improper fractions.
        Before adding these improper fractions, we need to make sure they have the same denominator.
        When fractions have the same denominators we add the numerators and put the result over the common denominator.

                Juma's family was expecting visitors that evening. In preparation, Juma's mother bought <m>1 \frac{1}{2}</m> kg of meat.
                Later, his father bought an additional <m>2 \frac{1}{4}</m> kg of meat to ensure there was enough for everyone. How much meat did they have altogether?

            <p>
                Work out: <m>7 \frac{2}{5} + 3 \frac{1}{4}</m>

        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                Convert the mixed fractions into improper fractions.
            </p>
            <sidebyside>
                <p>
                    <m>7 \frac{2}{5} = \frac{(5 \times 7)+2}{5} = \frac{37}{5}</m>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <m>3 \frac{1}{4} = \frac{(4 \times 3)+1}{4} = \frac{13}{4}</m>
                </p>

            <p>
                The denominators are different, so we have to find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the denominators, i.e., LCM of <m>5</m> and <m>4 =</m> <m>20</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the help of the LCM, we will write their respective equivalent fractions so that they become like fractions. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Multiply the numerator and denominator of <m>\frac{37}{5}</m>  by <m>4</m> to get <m>\frac{148}{20}</m>, 
                and also multiply the numerator and denominator of <m>\frac{13}{4}</m> by <m>5</m> to get <m>\frac{65}{20}</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, we have both the fractions with the same denominators, that is, they have been converted to like fractions.
                So, we can add them, i.e,

            </p>
            <p>
                Convert the improper fraction <m>\frac{213}{20}</m> to a mixed fraction as,
            </p>

                    <mrow>\frac{213}{20}  \amp = 10 \frac{13}{20}</mrow>
                    <mrow></mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp = 10 \frac{13}{20} </mrow>
