        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Work out: <m>\frac{3}{4} - \frac{1}{5}</m>
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    Check the denominators (bottom numbers) of each fraction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In our fractions the denominators have different numbers this means we are dealing with unlike fraction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We need to make the denominators the same by finding the LCM of the denominators.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To find the LCM of <m>4</m> and <m>5</m>, list out the multiples of the two denominators and find the smallest number that is the same between the two.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Multiples of <m>4</m> are <m>4,8,12,16,{\color{blue}20},24,28,32,36,{\color{blue}40},44,48,52,56,{\color{blue}60},64,...</m>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Multiples of <m>5</m> are <m>5,10,15,{\color{blue}20},25,30,35,{\color{blue}40},45,50,55,{\color{blue}60},65,...</m>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Common multiples are <m>{\color{blue}20},{\color{blue}40},{\color{blue}60}</m>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The least common multiples is <m>{\color{blue}20}</m>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Multiply the numerator by whatever number you needed to multiply the denominator by to change it into the lowest common denominator. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Multiply both the numerator and denominator of <m>\frac{3}{4}</m> by <m>5</m> to get <m>\frac{15}{20}</m>. 
                    Then, multiply the numerator and denominator of <m>\frac{1}{5}</m> by <m>4</m> to get <m>\frac{4}{20}</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that the denominators are the same, subtract the numerators just like you would subtract regular whole numbers and maintain the common denominator on the bottom.
