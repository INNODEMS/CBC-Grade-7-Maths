                     Otuoma, a baker, is excited to surprise his family with three delicious cakes.
                     He eagerly pulls out his recipe book, only to realize he needs to calculate the sugar needed. 
                     Each cake, according to the recipe, requires a <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> kg of sugar. Otuoma wonders the total amount of sugar he will need in total?.
                     Can you help Otuoma figure out how much sugar he needs to bake his surprise cakes?

                                To multiply a proper fraction by a whole number, multiply the numerator of the fraction by the whole number and retain the same denominator.

                            <p>

                                    <mrow> \amp = \frac{20}{7} </mrow>

                                We now, convert resulting the improper fraction <m>\frac{20}{7}</m> into a mixed fraction.
