                In her daily life, Cherotich often measures milk and juice in liters. Today, she has a 6.3 liter container of milk and wants to pour it into small bottles, each holding 0.7 liters.Therefore, Cherotich uses division of decimal number by a decimal number to find out how many bottles she needs.
                Just like how we use whole numbers to count objects, Cherotich also uses division of decimals to measure and divide quantities accurately.

            <statement>
                <p>
                    Erick had a sugarcane whose length was <m>6.84</m> m. He cut the sugarcane into equal pieces of <m>2.28 </m> m. How many pieces did he get?

            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    Equal pieces of sugarcane Erick got is given by:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <m>6.84 \text{ m } \div 2.28 \text{ m } = \frac{6.84}{2.28}</m>

                <p>
                    Multiply both the numerator and the denomenator by <m>100</m> to eliminate the decimals.

                  Therefore,  Erick got <m>3</m> pieces of sugarcane.

        </example>
        <example>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Work out: <m>9.45 \div 2.25 = </m>
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                 First, we express <m>9.45 \div 2.25 </m> as a fraction: = <m> \frac{945}{100} \div \frac{225}{100} </m>
                </p>
                <p>
                   Then multiply <m> \frac{945}{100}</m> by  <m> \frac{100}{225} </m> which is the reciprocal of <m> \frac{225}{100} </m>, to get: 
                </p>

                <p>
                    From the above, <m> 45</m> is the common factor hence <m> \frac{945}{225} \div \frac{45}{45}</m> gives <m>\frac{21}{5}</m>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dividing <m>\frac{21}{5}</m> we get <m>4.2</m>.

                <p>
                    Therefore, <m>9.45 \div 2.25 = 4.2 </m>
