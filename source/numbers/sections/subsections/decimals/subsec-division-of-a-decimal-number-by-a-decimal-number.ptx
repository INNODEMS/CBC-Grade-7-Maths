            <li>
                <p>
                    Express the division as a fraction .Example <m>6.3 รท 0.7 </m> can be written as 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <m>\frac{63}{10} \div \frac{7}{10}</m>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Convert division into multiplication that is instead of dividing, multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction i.e
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <m>\frac{63}{10} \times \frac{10}{7}</m> = <m>\frac{63}{\cancel{10}} \times \frac{\cancel{10}}{7}</m>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Simplify the fraction : <m>\frac{63}{7}</m> = <m>9</m>.

            In her daily life, Cherotich often measures milk and juice in liters. Today, she has a 6.3 liter container of milk and wants to pour it into small bottles, each holding 0.7 liters.Therefore, Cherotich uses division of decimal number by a decimal number to find out how many bottles she needs.
            Just like how we use whole numbers to count objects, Cherotich also uses division of decimals to measure and divide quantities accurately.

            5. Each group to start at a different station (e.g., one in class, another at the assembly ground, another near the school entrance) and solves the problem on their question papers together. Correct answers earn the group the next clue to find the next question.
