                        The word angle comes from the latin word <em>angulus</em>, meaning <q>corner</q>. An angle is represented by the symbol <m>\angle.</m> 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Angles are formed when two lines intersect at point (also known as <em>vertex </em>). In geometry, an angle is formed when two rays are joined at their endpoints. Rays are also known as sides or arms of the angle.

                <p>
                    Here is an interactive activity for you to explore the different types of angles.

                    What angles have you discovered from this activity?

                <p>
                    Now, explore the objects around you and find the different types of angles in your sorrounding. What angles did you find?

                <p>
                    Did you know one of the real life applications of angles is in <em>Carpentary?</em> 
                </p>

                <p>
                    For example, when carpenters are making a chair, 
                    they use angles to cut the wood so that the legs of the chair slants at the desired angle thereby creating a stable and beautiful designs.  
                </p>

                <p>   
                    
                    They typically use a combination of measuring tools, like a protractor and a combination square, to mark the angles on the wood before cutting, often aiming for a slight outward slant on the legs for stability and comfort

                                   Angles are formed when two rays intersect at a vertex. The opening between the two rays is called an angle, represented by a symbol <m>\angle .</m>
