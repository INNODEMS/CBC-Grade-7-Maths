                                Measuring angles is a significant topic in geometry. An angle can be measured using a protractor. An angle is measured in degrees, hence its called degree measure. One complete revolution is equal to <m>360^\circ</m>, hence it is divided into <m>360</m> parts. Each part of the revolution is a degree. If we know how to measure angle, then it will be very easy to construct an angle using a protractor.

                                A protractor is a semi-circular tool used to draw and measure angles. It is marked with degrees from <m>0^\circ</m> to <m>180^\circ</m>. It can be directly used to measure any angle from <m>0^\circ</m> to <m>360^\circ</m> . The markings are made in two ways, <m>0^\circ</m> to <m>180^\circ</m>  from right to left and vice versa.

                        Suppose we have an angle to measure say, <m>\angle ABC</m>. Follow the steps given below to measure the angle.

                                    Put the protractor above the line <m>BC</m> such that the midpoint of protractor is at point <m>B</m>.
                                </p>

                                    Adjust the protractor in such a way that <m>BC</m> is parallel to the straight-edge of the protractor.
                                </p>

                                    The protractor has two scales marked from <m>0^\circ</m> to <m>180^\circ</m> on both the ends. Take the reading where <m>BC</m> coincides with the <m>0^\circ</m>.

                                    Now from <m>0^\circ</m>, check the line <m>BA</m> coincides with the curved edges of the protractor. This reading gives us the measure of angle <m>ABC</m>.
