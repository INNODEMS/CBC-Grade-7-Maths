                Geometrical construction is the process of creating geometric shapes, figures, or diagrams using basic tools, like a compass, ruler and protractor. The goal is to draw precise shapes without measurements, relying on rules of geometry. Examples of geometric constructions include drawing a line segment, bisecting an angle, or constructing a perpendicular e.t.c
