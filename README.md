## To Do

* (Important but not top priority) License: What license do we want? By default the repo has MIT license in the license file. In the front matter, we have Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 (I don't think that's what we want). Discuss with Mike, Zach and others what license is the best, how to reference it and how to set it up in the repository and in the frontmatter.ptx file.
* In the frointmatter.ptx, we need to decide what to include, how and make details complete and consistent.
* Naming Convention: What do you want the chapter and section files to be called? You need consistency in naming files, eg chapters and sections.
* Very Important: Try not to overlap work. Who is doing what? How are you distributing the work?
* Very Important: Organise your files carefully in folders and sub-folders.
* Very important: Anything that you have not worked on, delete from your source folder. We need one folder in one repo for each chapter, any chapters that are not relevant to what you are doing should be deleted.
* Very important: If multiple repos contain content from the same chapter, make sure you know what this is.
